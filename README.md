## How To Build A Single Document

When you are updating or fixing one document set, you may prefer to
build only that component.

As an example, to build the SC-OBC Module V1 manual, clone its documentation
repository next to `sc-docs`:

```
git clone https://github.com/spacecubics/sc-docs-v1
```

After clone them, you will have directories like this:

```
tree -L 1
.
├── sc-docs
└── sc-docs-v1

```

Then, you can build the documentation using antora-playbook-v1-local.yml:

```
cd sc-docs
npx antora antora-playbook-v1-local.yml
```
